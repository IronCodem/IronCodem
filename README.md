🏫 I go to George H. Moody Middle School and I love to learn new things!

🏏Sometimes, I like to play cricket and soccer, except the COVID times where I just play Cricket 2011 (the EA game)

👨🏻‍💻 You can find me on [Replit.com](http://repl.it/@YashasShah) and [GitHub](http://github.com/ParrotCode101)

🌱 Learning Next.js and React.js

🤯 I started coding in first grade (at that time it was Scratch and only Scratch)
